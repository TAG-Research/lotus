LOTUS makes LLM-powered data processing fast and easy. 

LOTUS (**L**LMs **O**ver **T**ables of **U**nstructured and **S**tructured Data) provides a declarative programming model and an optimized query engine for serving powerful reasoning-based query pipelines over structured and unstructured data! We provide a simple and intuitive Pandas-like API, that implements **semantic operators**. 

# Installation
```
conda create -n lotus python=3.10 -y
conda activate lotus
pip install lotus-ai
```

## Running on Mac
If you are running on mac, please install Faiss via conda:

### CPU-only version
```
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu=1.8.0
```

### GPU(+CPU) version
```
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.8.0
```
For more details, see [Installing FAISS via Conda](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/main/INSTALL.md#installing-faiss-via-conda).

# Quickstart
If you're already familiar with Pandas, getting started will be a breeze! Below we provide a simple example program using the semantic join operator. The join, like many semantic operators, are specified by **langex** (natural language expressions), which the programmer uses to specify the operation. Each langex is parameterized by one or more table columns, denoted in brackets. The join's langex serves as a predicate and is parameterized by a right and left join key.
```python
import pandas as pd
import lotus
from lotus.models import LM

# configure the LM, and remember to export your API key
lm = LM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
lotus.settings.configure(lm=lm)

# create dataframes with course names and skills
courses_data = {
    "Course Name": [
        "History of the Atlantic World",
        "Riemannian Geometry",
        "Operating Systems",
        "Food Science",
        "Compilers",
        "Intro to computer science",
    ]
}
skills_data = {"Skill": ["Math", "Computer Science"]}
courses_df = pd.DataFrame(courses_data)
skills_df = pd.DataFrame(skills_data)

# lotus sem join 
res = courses_df.sem_join(skills_df, "Taking {Course Name} will help me learn {Skill}")
print(res)

# Print total LM usage
lm.print_total_usage()
```


## Key Concept: The Semantic Operator Model
LOTUS' implements is the semantic operator programming model. Semantic operators as declarative transformations on one or more datasets, parameterized by a natural language expression, that can be implemented by a variety of AI-based algorithms. Semantic operators seamlessly extend the relational model, operating over tables that may contain traditional structured data as well as unstructured fields, such as free-form text. These composable, modular language- based operators allow you to write AI-based pipelines with high-level logic, leaving the rest of the work to the query engine! Each operator can be implemented and optimized in multiple ways, opening a rich space for execution plans, similar to relational operators. To learn more about the semantic operator model, read the full [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11418).

LOTUS offers a number of semantic operators in a Pandas-like API, some of which are described below. To learn more about semantic operators provided in LOTUS, check out the full [documentation](https://lotus-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), run the [colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OzoJXH13aOwNOIEemClxzNCNYnqSGxVl?usp=sharing), or you can also refer to these [examples](https://github.com/TAG-Research/lotus/tree/main/examples/op_examples).

| Operator   | Description                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| sem_map      |  Map each record using a natural language projection| 
| sem_filter   | Keep records that match the natural language predicate |  
| sem_extract  | Extract one or more attributes from each row        |
| sem_agg      | Aggregate across all records (e.g. for summarization)             |
| sem_topk     | Order the records by some natural langauge sorting criteria                 |
| sem_join     | Join two datasets based on a natural language predicate       |
| sem_sim_join | Join two DataFrames based on semantic similarity             |
| sem_search   | Perform semantic search the over a text column                |


# Supported Models
There are 3 main model classes in LOTUS:
- `LM`: The language model class.
    - The `LM` class is built on top of the `LiteLLM` library, and supports any model that is supported by `LiteLLM`. See [this page](CONTRIBUTING.md) for examples of using models on `OpenAI`, `Ollama`, and `vLLM`. Any provider supported by `LiteLLM` should work. Check out [litellm's documentation](https://litellm.vercel.app) for more information.
- `RM`: The retrieval model class.
    - Any model from `SentenceTransformers` can be used with the `SentenceTransformersRM` class, by passing the model name to the `model` parameter (see [an example here](examples/op_examples/dedup.py)). Additionally, `LiteLLMRM` can be used with any model supported by `LiteLLM` (see [an example here](examples/op_examples/sim_join.py)).
- `Reranker`: The reranker model class.
    - Any `CrossEncoder` from `SentenceTransformers` can be used with the `CrossEncoderReranker` class, by passing the model name to the `model` parameter (see [an example here](examples/op_examples/search.py)).
