sem_agg
======================

Overview
---------
This operator performs an aggregation over the input relation, with
a langex signature that provides a commutative and associative aggregation function

Motivation
-----------
Semantic aggregations are useful for tasks, such as summarization and reasoning across multiple rows of the dataset. 



Examples
---------
.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd

    import lotus

    from lotus.models import LM

    lm = LM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
    lotus.settings.configure(lm=lm)

    data = {
        "ArticleTitle": [
            "Advancements in Quantum Computing",
            "Climate Change and Renewable Energy",
            "The Rise of Artificial Intelligence",
            "A Journey into Deep Space Exploration"
        ],
        "ArticleContent": [
            """Quantum computing harnesses the properties of quantum mechanics 
            to perform computations at speeds unimaginable with classical machines. 
            As research and development progress, emerging quantum algorithms show 
            great promise in solving previously intractable problems.""",
            
            """Global temperatures continue to rise, and societies worldwide 
            are turning to renewable resources like solar and wind power to mitigate

            """Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown rapidly, integrating 
            into various industries. Machine learning models now enable systems to 
            learn from massive datasets, improving efficiency and uncovering hidden

            """Deep space exploration aims to understand the cosmos beyond

            may one day enable human travel to far-off celestial bodies."""
        ]
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    df = df.sem_agg("Provide a concise summary of all {ArticleContent} in a single paragraph, highlighting the key technological progress and its implications for the future.")
    print(df._output[0])

Output:

.. code-block:: text
    
    "Recent technological advancements are reshaping various fields and have significant implications for the future. 
    Quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool capable of solving complex problems at unprecedented speeds, while the 
    global shift towards renewable energy sources like solar and wind power aims to combat climate change and transform economies. 
    In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, rapid growth and integration into industries are enhancing efficiency and revealing 
    hidden data patterns, though ethical concerns regarding privacy and bias persist. Additionally, deep space exploration is 
    advancing with missions targeting exoplanets and black holes, potentially paving the way for human travel beyond our solar 
    system through improved propulsion and life support technologies."

Example with group-by
---------------------
.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import lotus
    from lotus.models import LM

    lm = LM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
    lotus.settings.configure(lm=lm)

    # Example DataFrame
    data = {
        "Category": ["Tech", "Env", "Tech", "Env"],
        "ArticleContent": [
            "Quantum computing shows promise in solving complex problems.",
            "Renewable energy helps mitigate climate change.",
            "AI improves efficiency but raises ethical concerns.",
            "New holes in the ozone layer have been found."
        ]
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Perform semantic aggregation with groupby
    df = df.sem_agg(
        "Summarize the {ArticleContent} for each {Category}.",
        groupby=["Category"]
    )

    print(df._output)

Output:

Required Parameters
--------------------
- **user_instructions** : Prompt to pass into LM

Optional Parameters
--------------------
- **all_cols** : Whether to use all columns in the dataframe. 
- **suffix** : The suffix for the new column
